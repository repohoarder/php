	Hosting Account Setup will recognize a change of ownership of account(s) with, of websites hosted by, and/or of domains registered with Hosting Account Setup or its affiliates only in the event that at least one of the following occur: i) there is received by the Compliance Manager (support@AllPhase.com) a written statement (in a form acceptable to Hosting Account Setup or applicable affiliate) containing the notarized signature of the original owner of the account, website, and/or domain, as applicable, confirming that ownership of the website, domain, and/or account, as applicable, has been transferred to a person (claimant) claiming to own said website, domain and/or account, as applicable, along with a written statement containing the notarized signature of the claimant confirming that she or he has acquired said ownership, has read and agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service; or, ii) Hosting Account Setup is served with a valid order of a court, agency, or appropriate internet controlling entity such as Internt Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (&#8220;ICANN&#8221;), requiring Hosting Account Setup (or affiliate) to transfer such ownership to said claimant.<br />
	Subscriber acknowledges and accepts that the foregoing policies and procedures regarding transfer of ownership are the only way that notice(s) can be given and changes can be effected regarding said transfer of ownership within Hosting Account Setup; and, further, that any other changes made directly by Subscriber or by others within the online records of Hosting Account Setup or of its affiliates shall not be deemed effective to give notice to Hosting Account Setup or its affiliates of any changes in said ownership.<br />

Disputing Site or Account Ownership Disputes sometimes arise between or among multiple persons claiming ownership of or rights in a site hosted by Hosting Account Setup or in an associated Hosting Account Setup account. Hosting Account Setup is not obligated to resolve any such disputes. If multiple persons are claiming ownership of or rights in a site hosted by Hosting Account Setup or in an associated Hosting Account Setup account, and, in Hosting Account Setup&#8217;s sole judgment, there is not certainty as to the ownership of or rights in said site or account, then Hosting Account Setup will, to the extent of its knowledge and ability, notify said persons of the dispute and demand that said persons promptly, conclusively, and finally resolve the dispute in a manner which makes clear who the owner(s) and/or interest holder(s) is/are and in a manner which relieves Hosting Account Setup of all liability or obligations concerning the dispute. If the disputing persons fail so to resolve the dispute within what Hosting Account Setup, in its sole judgment, deems to be a reasonable time, then Hosting Account Setup, at its option and without any obligation to do so, may, in accordance with and subject to the laws of the State of Ohio, file an interpleader action in a court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Ohio for the purpose of allowing the contending persons to resolve said dispute and to reach certainty regarding ownership of or rights in said site and/or account. The person or persons conclusively and finally determined by the interpleader action to be the rightful owner(s) or interest holder(s) of said site and/or associated account shall be obligated to reimburse Hosting Account Setup for all of its expenses relative to said interpleader action including without limit all its court costs and reasonable attorney fees. All amounts owed to Hosting Account Setup under this section 5.03 shall be deemed due and payable immediately upon thirty (30) days after judgment or settlement is reached.</p>

	<p><strong>IX. RIGHT TO CONTACT REGARDING POTENTIAL CUSTOMER REVIEW</strong></p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. If, as a Hosting Account Setup Subscriber, you give a review of Hosting Account Setup services, whether by phone, social media or email, you agree to grant Hosting Account Setup a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the words of your review in any media or technology and have these words attributed to you.</p>
	<p><strong>X. &#8220;UNLIMITED&#8221; USAGE POLICIES AND DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. What &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; means. Hosting Account Setup does not set an arbitrary limit or cap on the amount of resources a single Subscriber can use. In good faith and subject to these Terms, Hosting Account Setup makes every commercially reasonable effort to provide its Subscribers with all the storage and bandwidth resources needed to power their web sites successfully, as long as the Subscriber&#8217;s use of the service complies with these Terms. By not setting limits on key resources, we are able to provide simple, consistent pricing to our Subscribers as they grow their websites. As a result, a typical website may experience periods of great popularity and resulting increased storage without experiencing any associated increase in hosting charges.<br />
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. What &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; DOES NOT mean. Hosting Account Setup employs complex mechanisms to protect its Subscribers and systems from abuse. Hosting Account Setup&#8217;s offering of &#8220;unlimited&#8221; services is not intended to allow the actions of a single or few Subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other Subscribers.<br />
	Hosting Account Setup&#8217;s service is a shared hosting service, which means that multiple Subscriber web sites are hosted from the same server and share server resources. Hosting Account Setup&#8217;s service is designed to meet the typical needs of small business and home business website Subscribers in the United States. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, internationally based businesses, or non-typical applications better suited to a dedicated server.<br />
	Hosting Account Setup will make every commercially reasonable effort to provide additional resources to Subscribers who are using their website(s) consistent with these Terms, including moving Subscribers to newer and bigger shared servers as necessary. However, in order to ensure a consistent and quality experience for all Subscribers, Hosting Account Setup does place automated safeguards to protect against any one site growing too quickly and adversely impacting the system until Hosting Account Setup can evaluate said sites resource needs.<br />
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C. Unlimited Hosting Space; excessive MySQL files. Hosting Account Setup does not set arbitrary limits on the amount of disk space a Subscriber can use for the Subscriber&#8217;s website, nor does Hosting Account Setup charge additional fees based on an increased amount of storage used, provided the Subscriber&#8217;s use of storage complies with these Terms. Please note, however, that the Hosting Account Setup service is designed to host websites. Hosting Account Setup does NOT provide unlimited space for online storage, backups, or archiving of electronic files, documents, log files, etc., and any such prohibited use of the Services will result in the termination of Subscriber&#8217;s account, with or without notice. Accounts with a large number of files (inode count in excess of 200,000) can have an adverse affect on server performance. Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of MySQL/PostgreSQL tables (i.e., in excess of 1000 database tables) or of database size (i.e., in excess of 3GB total MySQL/PostgreSQL usage or 2GB MySQL/PostgreSQL usage in a single database) negatively affect the performance of the server. Hosting Account Setup may request that the number of files/inodes, database tables, or total database usage be reduced to ensure proper performance or may terminate the Subscriber&#8217;s account, with or without notice.<br />
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D. Unlimited File Transfer. Hosting Account Setup does not set arbitrary limits on the amount of visitor traffic a web site can receive or on the amount of content a Subscriber can upload to his/her/its website in a given month, nor does Hosting Account Setup charge additional fees based on increased use of bandwidth, as long as the Subscriber&#8217;s use of the Services complies with these Terms. In most cases, a Subscriber&#8217;s web site will be able to support as much traffic as the Subscriber can legitimately acquire. However, Hosting Account Setup reserves the right to limit processor time, bandwidth, processes, or memory in cases where it is necessary to prevent negatively impacting other Subscribers.<br />
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E. Unlimited Domain Hosting. Hosting Account Setup does not set arbitrary limits on the number of domain names a Subscriber can associate with the Subscriber&#8217;s web hosting account.</p>
