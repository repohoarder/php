					<p><strong>IX. RIGHT TO CONTACT REGARDING POTENTIAL CUSTOMER REVIEW</strong></p>
					<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. If, as a All Phase Subscriber, you give a review of All Phase services, whether by phone, social media or email, you agree to grant All Phase a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the words of your review in any media or technology and have these words attributed to you.</p>
					<p><strong>X. &#8220;UNLIMITED&#8221; USAGE POLICIES AND DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
					<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. What &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; means. All Phase does not set an arbitrary limit or cap on the amount of resources a single Subscriber can use. In good faith and subject to these Terms, All Phase makes every commercially reasonable effort to provide its Subscribers with all the storage and bandwidth resources needed to power their web sites successfully, as long as the Subscriber&#8217;s use of the service complies with these Terms. By not setting limits on key resources, we are able to provide simple, consistent pricing to our Subscribers as they grow their websites. As a result, a typical website may experience periods of great popularity and resulting increased storage without experiencing any associated increase in hosting charges.<br />
					<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. What &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; DOES NOT mean. All Phase employs complex mechanisms to protect its Subscribers and systems from abuse. All Phase&#8217;s offering of &#8220;unlimited&#8221; services is not intended to allow the actions of a single or few Subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other Subscribers.<br />
					All Phase&#8217;s service is a shared hosting service, which means that multiple Subscriber web sites are hosted from the same server and share server resources. All Phase&#8217;s service is designed to meet the typical needs of small business and home business website Subscribers in the United States. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, internationally based businesses, or non-typical applications better suited to a dedicated server.<br />
					All Phase will make every commercially reasonable effort to provide additional resources to Subscribers who are using their website(s) consistent with these Terms, including moving Subscribers to newer and bigger shared servers as necessary. However, in order to ensure a consistent and quality experience for all Subscribers, All Phase does place automated safeguards to protect against any one site growing too quickly and adversely impacting the system until All Phase can evaluate said sites resource needs.<br />
					<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C. Unlimited Hosting Space; excessive MySQL files. All Phase does not set arbitrary limits on the amount of disk space a Subscriber can use for the Subscriber&#8217;s website, nor does All Phase charge additional fees based on an increased amount of storage used, provided the Subscriber&#8217;s use of storage complies with these Terms. Please note, however, that the All Phase service is designed to host websites. All Phase does NOT provide unlimited space for online storage, backups, or archiving of electronic files, documents, log files, etc., and any such prohibited use of the Services will result in the termination of Subscriber&#8217;s account, with or without notice. Accounts with a large number of files (inode count in excess of 200,000) can have an adverse affect on server performance. Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of MySQL/PostgreSQL tables (i.e., in excess of 1000 database tables) or of database size (i.e., in excess of 3GB total MySQL/PostgreSQL usage or 2GB MySQL/PostgreSQL usage in a single database) negatively affect the performance of the server. All Phase may request that the number of files/inodes, database tables, or total database usage be reduced to ensure proper performance or may terminate the Subscriber&#8217;s account, with or without notice.<br />
					<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D. Unlimited File Transfer. All Phase does not set arbitrary limits on the amount of visitor traffic a web site can receive or on the amount of content a Subscriber can upload to his/her/its website in a given month, nor does All Phase charge additional fees based on increased use of bandwidth, as long as the Subscriber&#8217;s use of the Services complies with these Terms. In most cases, a Subscriber&#8217;s web site will be able to support as much traffic as the Subscriber can legitimately acquire. However, All Phase reserves the right to limit processor time, bandwidth, processes, or memory in cases where it is necessary to prevent negatively impacting other Subscribers.<br />
					<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E. Unlimited Domain Hosting. All Phase does not set arbitrary limits on the number of domain names a Subscriber can associate with the Subscriber&#8217;s web hosting account.</p>
